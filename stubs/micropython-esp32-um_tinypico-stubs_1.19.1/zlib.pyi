Zlib decompression.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.19.1/library/zlib.html

CPython module: :mod:`python:zlib` https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html .

This module allows to decompress binary data compressed with
`DEFLATE algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE>`_
(commonly used in zlib library and gzip archiver). Compression
is not yet implemented.

    """
    Create a `stream` wrapper which allows transparent decompression of
    compressed data in another *stream*. This allows to process compressed
    streams with data larger than available heap size. In addition to
    values described in :func:`decompress`, *wbits* may take values
    24..31 (16 + 8..15), meaning that input stream has gzip header.

       This class is MicroPython extension. It's included on provisional
       basis and may be changed considerably or removed in later versions.

<p>Detects when required MicroPython Tools dependencies are missing or need updates.</p>

<p>
    This inspection verifies that all necessary Python packages and tools are installed for the plugin to function
    properly.
    The MicroPython Tools plugin requires specific versions of packages like esptool for device communication and
    flashing.
    Missing or outdated dependencies will prevent features like firmware flashing and device management from working.
</p>

<p>
    The inspection checks for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Required Python packages (e.g., esptool) in the correct versions</li>
    <li>Premium feature dependencies if you have a Pro license</li>
</ul>

<pre><code># Missing: esptool==4.8.1
# Plugin features may be unavailable
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    This inspection provides a quick fix to automatically install or update all missing dependencies.
    The installation process runs in the background and shows progress in a modal dialog.

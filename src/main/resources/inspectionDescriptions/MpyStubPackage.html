<p>Detects when no stub package is selected while type hints are enabled.</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps identify projects where type hints are enabled but no valid stub package has been configured.
    Without a selected stub package, essential IDE features such as autocompletion, type checking, and documentation
    lookup will not function for MicroPython-specific APIs.
</p>

<p>
    To fix this, go to <a href="settings://dev.micropythontools.settings.MpyConfigurable">MicroPython Tools Settings</a>
    and select or install a stub package that matches your board and MicroPython version.

This plugin brings MicroPython support into JetBrains IDEs.
It provides reliable device file system integration, REPL support, stub package management, and smooth workflows for
developing both hobbyist and professional MicroPython projects.

Originally inspired by JetBrains’ MicroPython plugin, this project has since been fully reworked and expanded into a
standalone tool. Credit to [Jos Verlinde](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubs) for creating and maintaining the
stubs used here, and to [Ilia Motornyi](https://github.com/elmot) and
[Andrey Vlasovskikh](https://github.com/vlasovskikh) for their work on the original plugin.

**Installation & Docs:** Usage tips and documentation are available [here](DOCUMENTATION.md).
